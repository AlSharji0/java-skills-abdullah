Topics learnt:
- Dealing with strings and arrays of strings
- Object oriented programming practice
- Basic problem solving skills in java

I found writting the tests for each task to be the most time consuming.

The code has been tested by checking the functionality of each method with different edge cases.

I would like to improve the quality of my commit messages and code documentation.
